## üéØ Project Name & Summary:
Project Name: ActivityBlossom
Summary: ActivityBlossom is an intuitive task and habit tracker that helps users organize their lives while cultivating sustainable habits, all within a visually appealing flower-themed interface. By seamlessly integrating eco-friendly action tracking with daily planning, ActivityBlossom empowers users to prioritize productivity and make conscious choices towards a greener lifestyle, symbolized by the growth and beauty of flowers.

## üë• Target User:
Target User: Individuals seeking to improve their organization, prioritize tasks, and incorporate sustainable practices into their daily routines. This includes students, professionals, and anyone who appreciates a visually engaging and motivating approach to productivity and mindful living.
Specific Needs:
Effective task and event management.
A visually appealing and motivating interface.
A way to track and encourage sustainable actions.
Simple goal setting for both productivity and sustainability.
Positive reinforcement for completing tasks and making eco-conscious choices.

## üí° Purpose & Problem Statement:
Problem: Many individuals struggle to balance their daily tasks with a desire to live more sustainably. Existing organization tools often lack features that promote eco-friendly habits and can feel sterile or uninspiring.
Purpose: ActivityBlossom aims to bridge this gap by providing a platform that integrates task management with sustainability awareness, all within a visually engaging, flower-themed environment.
Superhero Superpower: ActivityBlossom's superpower is its ability to transform everyday tasks into opportunities for positive environmental impact, fostering a sense of mindful productivity and blooming a more sustainable lifestyle.

## üî• Core Features:
Task & Event Management (Flower Themed): Users can create, schedule, and prioritize tasks and events. Icons and visual elements can be flower-related (e.g., a bud for a new task, a blooming flower for a completed one).
"Eco-Friendly Action" Tracking: Users can check a box to indicate if a task was completed in a sustainable way. This action can trigger visual feedback like a flower blooming or petals being added to a flower icon.
Simple Sustainability Goal Setting: Users can set basic sustainability goals (e.g., "Use reusable water bottle daily"). Progress towards these goals can be visually represented through the flower theme.
Visual Progress Dashboard (Flower Inspired): A dashboard provides an overview of completed tasks and sustainability actions. This could be represented as a "garden" growing or individual flowers blooming.
User Profile and Customization: Users can personalize their experience with different flower themes, colors, and potentially even choose their "avatar flower."

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview:
Frontend (React):
Handles the user interface, incorporating flower-themed visuals and animations.
Uses GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and update data.
Backend (Node.js/Express/GraphQL):
Exposes a GraphQL API for managing tasks, events, and sustainability actions.
Manages user data and application logic.
Database (MongoDB):
Stores user data, tasks, events, and records of "Eco-Friendly Action" checks.
Communication:
The React frontend communicates with the Node.js/Express/GraphQL backend via HTTP requests.
GraphQL is used for efficient data fetching and manipulation.

# Project Retrospective (After Training):
## üöÄ Development Process & Challenges:
How did you approach building the project, incorporating the flower theme and sustainability features? (Brainstorming, planning, coding, testing, etc.)
What were the trickiest parts, especially in implementing the visual elements and sustainability tracking? How did you overcome them?

## üîÆ Future Improvements:
What additional flower-themed features or sustainability integrations could be implemented? (e.g., more complex goal tracking, integration with environmental APIs).
If you had unlimited time and resources, how would you make ActivityBlossom even more visually stunning and impactful in promoting sustainable living?

## üìå Conclusion & Reflections:
What did you learn from incorporating a theme into your project and integrating a real-world concept like sustainability?
If you could give advice to future "sweenies" taking on this training, especially those considering a themed project, what would it be?#
